## Software

### Core

*robot.ino* - the entry point with the standard Arduino setup() and loop() functions

*TaskInterface.h* - defines the parent class for all "tasks" which are given a quant of time in the main multitasking loop

*RobotAI.h/.cpp* - the core class which orchestrates all the robot actions (including scenarios execution and remote control over Wi-Fi)

### Robot modules

*RobotDistanceSensor.h/.cpp* - class for accessing the ultrasonic and infrared distance sensor

*RobotConnector.h/.cpp* - class for managing the remote connection through the serial interface

*RobotLights.h/.cpp* - class for controlling robot LED's

*RobotMotors.h/.cpp* - class for controling chasis motors

*RobotVoice.h/.cpp* - class for generating sounds

## Remote Control Protocol

Remote control is performed over Wi-Fi connection using simple telnet-like connection. It is also compatible with RoboRemo: http://www.roboremo.com/
